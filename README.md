ExDoc
=====

Documentation extractor.

Extracts pieces of documentation from your code to build a document which can be fed to template processors.

Output can be in JSON, YAML, whatever.
Use any command-line templating engine, like [j2cli](https://github.com/kolypto/j2cli), to render templates from it.

It does not do any automatic background magic: it just offers helpers which allows you to extract the necessary pieces.
